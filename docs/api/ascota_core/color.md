# ascota_core.color

The `color` module provides functionality for **color correction** and
**color-based clustering**. It aligns input images to a standard reference
using detected color cards, also contains functions to cluster and group similar
looking images. This ensures that downstream analysis works with normalized and
comparable color values.
