# ascota_classification

`ascota_classification` is the **second stage of the ASCOTA pipeline**. Currently in development.  

## Purpose
In this package, we focus on:  

- **Classification of sherd types**: Using deep learning models to classify pottery fragments into
  predefined categories based on shape and size.  

- **Color Classification**: Extracting relevant color features from segmented and color-corrected images
    to support classification and analysis.  

- **Texture Classification**: Identifying and labeling surface textures of pottery fragments to aid in
    classification and comparative analysis.  

- **Pattern/Decoration Classification**: Use vision transformer models to identify and classify decorative patterns
    on pottery fragments.
