# ascota_classification.decoration

The classification `decoration` module provides functionality for classifying
pottery decoration patterns into two main categories: impressed and incised.
Impressed decorations are created by pressing objects into the clay, while
incised decorations are made by cutting or carving into the clay surface.
The module uses a pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-L/14 model for feature extraction
combined with an optimized Linear Logistic Regression classifier, providing
accurate and reliable classification of pottery decoration patterns from
images with transparent backgrounds.
