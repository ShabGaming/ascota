# ascota_classification.color

The classification `color` module provides functionality for classifying
pottery sherds based on their color attributes. It includes methods for
classifying colors into predefined categories, extracting dominant colors from
images, and visualizing color distributions using 3 different methods. The methods
include lab thresholding, k-means clustering, and CLIP-ViT based classification. This
ensures that pottery sherds can be systematically categorized based on their color.
